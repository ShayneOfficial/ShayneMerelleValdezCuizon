She enjoys reading and collecting self-help books, building and collecting different kinds of rubics, painting, creating scrapbooks, vlogging, and editing graphic arts, pictures, and videos.

        <h3>It's Good to Hear From Others </h3>
        <p> It's always good to hear from others! Interacting and communicating with others is an essential part of human life, as it helps us to build relationships, gain knowledge and understanding, and develop empathy and compassion.

            When we hear from others, we get a chance to learn about their experiences, perspectives, and opinions. This can broaden our own understanding and help us see things from different angles. It can also challenge our own assumptions and biases, which is important for personal growth and development.
            
            Moreover, when we engage in meaningful conversations with others, we feel more connected and less isolated. We are social beings, and we thrive on social interactions. Even in today's digital age, where much of our communication happens online, the need for human connection remains as strong as ever.
            
            So, whether it's a casual conversation with a friend, a deep discussion with a colleague, or a heartfelt exchange with a loved one, it's always good to hear from others. It can enrich our lives and bring us closer together as human beings.</p>

                <p>I want to become a doctor because I have a deep passion for helping others and making a positive impact on their lives. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the struggles and challenges that come with illness, both in myself and in my loved ones. I was always fascinated by the human body and how it works, and I knew that I wanted to use my knowledge and skills to improve the lives of others.

                    As I grew older, my desire to become a doctor only grew stronger. I took classes in science, biology and chemistry to gain a better understanding of the field. I saw the incredible impact that doctors could have on patients, both through medical treatment and emotional support, and I knew that this was the career path for me.

                <p>Vlogging is an incredible platform that can have a profound impact on both the vlogger and their audience. For me, vlogging has been an amazing experience because it has allowed me to inspire others with my stories, opinions, and experiences. By sharing my life through video, I have been able to connect with people all over the world who have similar interests or experiences. Knowing that my videos have helped others in some way is incredibly rewarding and motivates me to continue vlogging.

                    Beyond the personal fulfillment that vlogging brings, it has also opened up new opportunities for me. As my audience has grown, I have been approached by brands to endorse their products or services. This has given me the chance to collaborate with companies that align with my values and beliefs, and has provided me with a source of income that I never thought was possible.</p>

                <p>
                    I had so much fun roleplaying and doing acting in our short film activity in school because it was a new and exciting experience that allowed me to explore a different side of myself. Prior to the activity, I had never considered myself to be particularly skilled at acting or performing in front of others. However, as I started to get more involved in the project, I discovered that I actually had a natural talent for it.

It was incredibly empowering to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, and the experience helped me gain a new level of self-confidence and self-assurance. I also loved the sense of teamwork and collaboration that came with working on the project with my classmates. We all had to work together to come up with creative ideas, develop our characters, and rehearse our scenes. It was a lot of hard work, but it was also incredibly rewarding.

Another reason why I loved the activity was because it allowed me to create lasting memories in the form of videos. It was amazing to see our ideas come to life on screen, and I loved the idea of being able to share our work with others. It was also really exciting to see the finished product and to know that we had created something that we could all be proud of.

Overall, the experience of roleplaying and doing acting in our short film activity was incredibly positive and transformative for me. It allowed me to discover new talents, build my self-confidence, and create lasting memories with my classmates. I am grateful for the opportunity and I will cherish the experience for years to come.

I love being a leader and striving to exhibit good leadership because it allows me to have a positive impact on those around me. As a leader, I am able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a common goal, and I find it incredibly fulfilling to see my team produce exceptional results. 

One of the things I love about being a leader is the sense of responsibility that comes with the role. It is up to me to set the tone and direction for the team, and I take this responsibility very seriously. I believe that good leadership requires a strong sense of accountability, and I always strive to hold myself and my team members to high standards of performance and behavior.

Being a leader also allows me to develop my own skills and knowledge. I love the challenge of learning new things and expanding my abilities, and I find that leadership provides ample opportunities for personal growth and development. I also enjoy the sense of satisfaction that comes from helping others develop their own skills and capabilities.

Finally, I love being a leader because it allows me to make a positive impact on my community and the world around me. I believe that good leadership is about serving others and working towards a common good, and I find it incredibly fulfilling to be able to make a difference in the lives of those around me. Whether I am leading a team at work, volunteering in my community, or advocating for social change, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to something greater than myself.

In summary, being a leader and striving for good leadership is important to me because it allows me to make a positive impact on those around me, develop my own skills and knowledge, and contribute to a greater good.

                <p>
                    Before the pandemic, I lived a carefree life, focusing on my studies and social life, but not taking things too seriously. However, when the pandemic hit, everything changed. The lockdowns and restrictions forced me to stay at home and re-evaluate my priorities.

                    At first, I struggled with the isolation and uncertainty, but as time passed, I began to see the pandemic as an opportunity to grow and develop as a person. I took up new hobbies, such as cooking and exercise, and started to focus more on my studies and personal development.
                    
                    As I adapted to the challenges of the pandemic, I began to feel more confident and mature than ever before. I became more responsible, taking on new tasks and challenges, and embracing the opportunities for personal growth that the pandemic presented.
                    
                    Looking back, I can see that the pandemic was a turning point in my life. It forced me to confront my weaknesses and take action to improve myself. Today, I am proud of the person I have become, and I am excited to see what the future holds as I continue to grow and mature.
